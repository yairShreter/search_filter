# React Interview Project - Live Search Filter

This is a minimal React interview project built with Vite specifically designed for testing candidates on the "Live Search Filter" component task.

## Project Purpose
This project provides a clean starting point for job interviews where candidates must implement a live search filter component that demonstrates:
- React state management with hooks
- Real-time filtering logic
- Component prop handling
- Performance considerations

## Key Files
- `src/App.jsx` - Main application with sample data
- `src/components/LiveSearchFilter.jsx` - Component candidates need to implement
- Sample data is provided as a prop to test filtering functionality

## Interview Guidelines
- Candidates should focus on the LiveSearchFilter component
- The component should accept data as props and manage filter state internally
- Real-time filtering should update as the user types
- Performance optimization discussions are encouraged

## Development
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- The task is clearly defined in the README.md file
- All necessary styling is pre-configured
